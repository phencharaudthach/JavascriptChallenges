Leap Year

create a function that accepts a year as a number and returns true or false that it is a leap year (you may also print to console that it is or isn't)

a leap year is any year divisible by 4,
unless it is also divisible by 100 then not a leap year,
unless also divisible by 400 then it is a leap year again.

2000 is a leap year
2004 is a leap year
1900 is not a leap year
1700 is not a leap year
1600 is a leap year
